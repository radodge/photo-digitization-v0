# Photo Digitization Application v0 - Legacy Demo
> *Version 1 of the application is in active development. The codebase lives in a private repository to safeguard intellectual property.*
## Overview
This repository contains a legacy prototype of my photo 'digitization' application. Follow the setup guide if you'd like to try the application for yourself.


## Usage Guide
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- For CUDA support: NVIDIA driver version >= 580
### Step 1 - Clone the repository
Navigate to any folder in your system and clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/radodge/photo-digitization-v0.git
cd photo-digitization-v0
```

### Step 2 - Run `run_legacy_demo.py`
From the cloned repository root:

```powershell
python -m ./run_legacy_demo.py
```

### **What happens**:
Setup/bootstrapping is all handled automatically. Python packages installed by my setup script will be installed to `~/.venv/Lib/site-packages` instead of `C:/Program Files/Python313/Lib/site-packages`

### Try it

Drop an image into `./Ingest/` (supported: .tif/.tiff/.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.bmp/.heic/.webp). The app will:
1) Auto-split the composite into subphotos.
2) Let you preview and confirm.
3) Save subphotos into `./Processed Photos/` (HEIC and JPEG by default) and inject metadata if ExifTool is available.

Tip: In Debug mode, use the menu Debug â†’ Simulate Ingest File to trigger processing with existing files in `Ingest`.
